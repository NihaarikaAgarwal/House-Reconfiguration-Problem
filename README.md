# House-Reconfiguration-Problem

The House Reconfiguration Problem (HRP) extends the House Configuration Problem (HCP) by accommodating varying sizes of items (short or long) in cabinets. It involves assigning cabinets to rooms, each room housing up to four cabinets. New rooms or cabinets may be introduced, and existing cabinets can be converted into high cabinets.
